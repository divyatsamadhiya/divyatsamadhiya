# 👋 Hi, I’m Divyat Samadhiya

🚀 Backend Engineer | Fintech | Distributed Systems  
📍 Bangalore, India

I’m a backend-focused software engineer with **6+ years of experience** building **reliable, scalable, and high-throughput systems**, primarily in **fintech and banking domains**. I enjoy working close to the core of complex systems—where correctness, performance, and resilience actually matter.

---

## 🧠 What I Do Best

- Design and build **distributed backend systems** that scale and fail gracefully  
- Work extensively with **event-driven architectures**, **CQRS**, and **event sourcing**  
- Build **AWS-native microservices** used in real-world financial pipelines  
- Own features end-to-end: from design → implementation → production support  
- Write **clean, testable, production-grade code** (not just code that “works”)  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages & Runtime**
- TypeScript / JavaScript (Node.js)
- SQL & NoSQL data modeling

**Backend & Architecture**
- Microservices, REST APIs, Event-driven systems  
- CQRS, Event Sourcing, Idempotent workflows  
- High-volume transaction processing

**Databases**
- MongoDB / DocumentDB  
- DynamoDB  
- PostgreSQL  

**Cloud & DevOps**
- AWS (Lambda, S3, SNS/SQS, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, ECS, Batch)
- Infrastructure-aware development
- Observability, logging, and metrics-first mindset

**Testing**
- Jest
- Unit, System & integration testing  

---

## 🏦 Domain Experience

- Core banking & fintech platforms  
- Payment processing & settlement pipelines  
- Ledger consistency & reconciliation systems  
- Handling edge cases in **money movement** (the hard parts 😄)

---

## 🧩 How I Think

- **Correctness > Cleverness**
- **Simple systems scale better than complex ones**
- Production issues are feedback, not failures
- Good abstractions reduce cognitive load for teams

I’m comfortable operating in **ambiguity**, reviewing critical PRs, and influencing system design across teams—while still being hands-on with code.

---

## 📈 Currently Exploring

- Backend technical leadership & system design at scale  
- Improving developer velocity using **AI-assisted tooling**  
- Building systems that are easier to reason about under failure
